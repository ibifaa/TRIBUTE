                <p> Mary was born on the 25th of September, 1937 in Chicago. Mary wanted to be a litigator but her mentors, friends and folkes thinks otherwise. They discouraged her from being a layer, this is due to the challenges they think women face becoming or remaining as a lawyer during that time. </p>
                <p> Her Geography teacher told her to be a programmer, she never discovered this picture of her since she keep looking at the mirror of her life, but her Geography teacher saw it. This is to tell us that a times our best mirrorrs could be people around us, they se a clearer image of who we really than what we see for ourselfes. Mary keyed into the picture panted by her geography teacher and discovered her true self.  </p>
                <p> Today she is known as one of the pioneers of programming and the first female to own a peronsal computer. Not only have she been an inspiration to people around her but to every woman that have the ambition of becoming a programmer.</p>
